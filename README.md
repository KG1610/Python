=======
I am learning Python and need to learn how to use Git. I see the all devs use git. I come from TFS and its nicer :)
Syncing Home and Work Machines with this. 

Starting off with python scripts close to my Day Job as a BI Developer (Basic Automation and ETL Tasks ....whatever I can do ....etc)
Hoping I can keep the momentum up and learn how to code and leave sql query land!
