I am learning Python and need to learn how to use Git. I see many devs use git. 7 years of Business Intelligence and have only used TFS thus far:)
Syncing Home and Work Machines.

Starting off with python scripts close to my Day Job as a BI Developer (Basic Automation and ETL Tasks ....whatever I can figure out to do)
Hoping I can keep the momentum up and learn how to code and leave sql query land! Well not leave it rather bring it with and break free from query island and explore the world of programming.
